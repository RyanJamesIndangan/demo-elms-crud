# Notes
1.) Make sure to have Composer, PHP 7.4+ and MySQL 5.7+ installed in your server.
2.) I copied your 404 page, please don't be mad hehe.
3.) I kind of deviated a bit to retain my coding style preferences, but definitely neat, easy to understand and implement.
4.) The database I designed and developed is highly scalable, meaning we can diverse from whatever spaghetti I build hahaha.
5.) Mostly I used TEXT so that you can try whatever, usually I use VARCHAR and limit it by 2s.. 2,4,8,16 and so on until 2048, cause if the column can be higher than that, I will just use TEXT instead

# Future Updates When Hired 👀
1.) Robust Validations - For Example: Checks for same question, accepts only 1 correct answer, checks image url if existing and a lot lot more.
2.) Build them into a game or examination - since this is just for questions only, we can map it and hone it into a game (compilation of questions to make a game/exam/test/trial).
3.) Will follow the team's preferred coding convention - I prefer to use snake_case, but I will adapt to any coding standard that the team have.
4.) Solid audit trailing - notifications, account history etc and what not.
5.) Some calls me "10x Developer" some says "Unicorn Developer" but maybe I'm just some regular everyday developer, who knows? (Please Hire Me lmao 🙏🙏🙏, I work smarter and harder than most 🙇🙇🙇, I'm a fun guy, you don't want another stressful colleague don't you? Hehe 😆✌️).
